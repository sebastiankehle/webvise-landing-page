You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization

- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions

- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
  - Use only for Web API access in small components.
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management.

Package Manager and Dependencies

- Use pnpm as the package manager.
- When installing packages with React 19:
  - Use 'pnpm install --force' or '--legacy-peer-deps'
  - Handle peer dependency conflicts appropriately
- For shadcn/ui with Next.js 15 and React 19:
  - Use CLI with appropriate flags when prompted
  - Most core dependencies are React 19 compatible
  - For recharts, add React 19 override in package.json
  - Do not consider React 18 as a fallback

IDE Configuration

- Do not change my eslintrc.json file.
- Do not change my prettierrc file.
- Do not change my cursorrules file.
- Do not change my vscode settings.
